PicturEci is based on the game "Pictionary" and other similar online,
The game will have the classic modes of competing with a limited time, and words by category, etc ...
The added value of the project lies in a new gameplay that will test the ability to concentrate and
Multitasking of the players, since in addition to a player draws the object that was requested,
ISimultaneously another third player tries to guess the drawing.
and as if this were not enough, you will have extreme ways to give your game more fun, 
with limited time, complicated objects, and many other things.

A possible future advance in the architecture is considered to guarantee availability, and scalability. A posbile architecture of the same would be this:
